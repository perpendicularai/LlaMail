## Project Background
The idea of having to read endless amounts of email is cumbersome, many may agree that their inbox is a sheer mess. To address this dilemma, we make use of generative ai to formulate a response to an email read using imap. This debatebly eliminates skipping or missing an email and can help drive the challenge towards inbox zero.

## Getting started
- Ensure that you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) installed and served on the device you are running the email client on. The api endpoint is hardcoded as http://localhost:11434/api/generate.
- Once that has been done, download the repo as a zip archive, extract the contents and choose between installing it using powershell or by double-cliking the msi-installer. This will install it as a program on your device and can be launched from the start-menu. See below:
